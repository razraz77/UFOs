# UFOs

## Overview of the Project:
The Purpose of this analysis was to provide a more in-depth system for filtering the data of UFO sightings based on different criteria. These filters inculde: date, city, state, country, and shape of the sighting.

## Results:
The data can be filtered by navigating to the the search bars on the left side of the web page and inputing as many different criteria as desired.
Here is an example:

##Summary:
One major drawback of this system is the inabilty to distinguish which sightings are all part of the same event. Although there are only a few instances where there is an over lap in the search criteria, it is clear that with a larger data set it would be difficult to detirmine which sightings are actually part of the same event. For the future, it is recomended that data on the exact time the event took place is able to be filtered for to avoid confusion. Furthermore, it is also recomended that similar events were to have their own column and thus all the sightings for that particular event could be grouped.
